    - Bug Fixes

        - Removed items trapped outside the level.

        - Freezer ammo now included in MP soul pickup [requires client fix].

        - Prevent ammo pick with max ammo for minigun, shurikens, and electro.

    - Changes

        - Added chat spam protection which prevents players from spamming the console
          by speaking too frequently.  Once triggered, you're prevented from speaking
          for 15 seconds.

        - Limited suicide to once every 30 seconds.

        - Prevent damage when landing on jump pad from any height.

        - In weapons stay mode, you can continue to get ammo from a weapon even if
          you already have that weapon.  The weapon will raise up a little to
          indicate when it is charged with ammo.

        - The respawn times of weak and medium armor have been changed to 5 and 10
          respectively.

    - config.ini
