Version 0.1  Fri Feb 24 13:28:25 EST 2006

    - Bug Fixes

        - Freezer ammo now included in MP soul pickup.

        - Prevent ammo pick with max ammo for minigun, shurikens, and electro.

    - Changes

        - In weapons stay mode, you can continue to get ammo from a weapon even if
          you already have a that weapon.  The weapon will raise up a little to
          indicate when it is charged with ammo.

        - The respawn times of weak and medium armor have been changed to 5 and 10
          respectively.

    - config.ini

        - Cfg.WeaponsChargeUp [0/1: 1]
        - Cfg.WeaponsChargeUpTime [seconds: 15]
        - Cfg.ArmorStrongRespawnTime [seconds: 20]
        - Cfg.ArmorMediumRespawnTime [seconds: 10]
        - Cfg.ArmorWeakRespawnTime [seconds: 5]
